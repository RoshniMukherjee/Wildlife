        By educating the public and supporting conservation efforts globally, we
        aim to create a world where wildlife can thrive, and ecosystems are
        preserved. Join us in making a difference, whether it's by donating,
        volunteering, or simply spreading the word about the urgent need to save

        That is 27% of all species. Moreover, the worldâ€™s wildlife is being lost
        up to 10,000 times faster than the natural extinction rate.

        Animals and plants arenâ€™t just valuable for their own sake â€“ theyâ€™re
        also part of a wider natural environment that may provide food, shelter,
        water, and other functions, for other wildlife and people. <br /><br />

        You need to educate your family about endangered species in your area,
        recycle and buy sustainable products and often volunteer to help save
        wildlife or create awareness.
